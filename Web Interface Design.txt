As a host:
init;
logIn;
getMapList;
hostGame;
Loop(preGameUpdateHost)
acceptMatch
downloadMap
Loop(updatePlayerStatus)


As a player:
init;
logIn;
requestToJoinPlayer;
Loop(preGameUpdatePlayer)
downloadMap
Loop(updatePlayerStatus)


when the game finishes, if it was a story map, the next map will be downloaded, otherwise it will return to the main screen. 
changeDisplayName should only be called from the main menu, no where else.
uploadMap can be used to upload a map. Can be called any time, but probably should only be used from a map creation screen.
