# Java-Game-APCS
Game for our APCS final exam

This game will be a 2-player Portal derivitive. The server is running on a Google App Engine instance.
The server source code is here: https://github.com/wiresboy/Java-Game-APCS-server

####Mr. H: 
If you think about it ahead of time, update the game from https://github.com/wiresboy/Java-Game-APCS/, since we may make breaking chagnes to the server setup.

#TO RUN:
Run src/main/Start.java

If the server is down but you want to play it, modify the variable singlePlayer in GamePanel to true, then run Start.java
Or you can contact Brandon (wiresboy) through github to set it back up.
