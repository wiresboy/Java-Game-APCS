# Java-Game-APCS
Game for APCS final exam
We will see how this goes

To use github at school:
download eclipse luna (it has git installed, and we can't install the github for windows client)
Set your workspace on H drive - I chose a new one, you can choose any that you want
under project explorer, import -> from git
Set the URI to https://github.com/wiresboy/Java-Game-APCS.git
Don't (i think) set authentication
make a commit
hope it works!
